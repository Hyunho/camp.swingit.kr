## [CSI 2024] Ticket opening information

Camp Swing It 2024, the biggest holiday for swing dancers, welcomes you!
Are you ready to end your pandemic break and embark on a new adventure? CSI focuses solely on swing jazz, swing dance, and socializing with people. Therefore, an opportunity to quench the thirst that has not been quenched for five years awaits you.
Let's make new memories by participating in this special experience filled with missed people, new encounters, and fun social activities. We look forward to even more upgraded energy and passion from those who have been waiting for CSI. We are waiting for you at the newly renovated Cheongshim.


## Ticket application

For applications for CSI 2024, we would like to provide a variety of options beyond the ticket sales method that has been packaged so far. In order to reduce the factor of price increase as much as possible and cater to the tastes and circumstances of participants, this time, we have separated parties, accommodations, meals, workshops, etc. so that they can choose individually.
This separate sales method will be a more reasonable choice for those who want to camp or drive home at the Cheongshim Training Center site, or who want to stay at a nearby accommodation or return home after a party, or who do not like group meals or need other options.
