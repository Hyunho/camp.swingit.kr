## [CSI Registration]

The CSI 2025 application system has been upgraded to allow for more individual selection than last year.

Parties, accommodations, meals, workshops, etc. are separated so that you can select them by item, and like a general shopping mall, after signing up as a member, you can add the items you want to your shopping cart and apply and pay at once.

Please remember that your application will be completed only after payment is completed.


- [Required] Party
- Ticket Open: 2024. 12. 10 (Tue) 2:00pm ~
- Ticket quantity: Open in stages for 50 pairs domestically and internationally.
  - Accommodation at the venue will be closed to the first 500 people.
  - In the case of party and competition applications, if the difference between the leader and follower exceeds 1.5 times, applications will be restricted.
- Reservation method: Application through the registration system on the website and card payment (however, KLHC competition applications are cash payments)
  - Applications will be closed in the order of deposit.

  - Applications will be closed in the order of deposit. If payment is not confirmed within 1 hour of application, the opportunity will be passed on to the person on the waiting list.
  - If you cannot purchase a ticket due to the low application ranking, a refund will be issued immediately.
