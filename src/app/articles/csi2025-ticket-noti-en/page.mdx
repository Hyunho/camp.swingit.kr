## [CSI 2025] Ticket Registration Guide

Camp Swing It 2025, the biggest holiday for swing dancers, is comingI
We invite you to the best event in Korea where more than 10 couples of the world's best dancers, including 4-5 couples of international instructors and 5-6 couples of Korean local instructors and guests, will participate.




## Ticket Application

The application system for CSI 2025 has been upgraded to allow for more individual selection than last year.

Parties, accommodations, meals, workshops, etc. have been separated so that you can individually select them, and like a general internet shopping mall, after signing up as a member, you can add the items you want to your shopping cart and apply and pay all at once. 
Please keep in mind that your application will be completed only after payment is completed.

More detailed notices and the registration system will open on DEC 1st.
