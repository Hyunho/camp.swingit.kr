## [CSI Registration]

The CSI 2025 application system has been upgraded to allow for more individual selection than last year.

Parties, accommodations, meals, workshops, etc. are separated by item, like a general shopping mall. After signing up as a member, you can add the items you want to your shopping cart and pay at once.

Please remember that your application will be confirmed only after payment is completed.

- Accommodation at the venue will be limited to the first 500 people.
- Party and competition applications will be restricted if the leader to follower ratio exceeds 1.5.
- Reservation method: Application through the registration system on the website and card payment (however, KLHC competition applications are cash payments)
- Applications will be confirmed in the order of deposit.
